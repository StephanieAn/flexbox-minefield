# Flex Minefield
made on July 5th, 2021

HTML issues:
------------
The biggest issue was to make the cell in HTML. To use a table tag or section tag and div tag ? I've chosen to use the section and div tag.

CSS issues:
-----------
Using flex was easier than what I thougth. The issue in CSS was for the unclicked box.

I've chosen to use button tag and opacity to have one element at the time. 

### No need to be responsive
